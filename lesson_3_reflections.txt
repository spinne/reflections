When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When collaborating (?) with others. To share my code with someone specific or make it public.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Code added by other might interfere with what I'm working on and might clutter my system.
